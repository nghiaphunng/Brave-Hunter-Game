<h1 align = "center" style="color : #40c930;">[PYTHON] BRAVE HUNTER</h1>

## Introduction
This game was created during my first year as a student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I developed the gameplay based on the concept of a dinosaur game on the Chrome (Dinosaur T-rex). During the time I worked on this game, my primary goal was to enhance my coding skills using Python. As a result, you may find similarities between this game and the browser-based dinosaur game.

## How to play
The gameplay is quite simple.
* As soon as you launch the program, the game will commence. Similar to the T-Rex dinosaur game, your character comes equipped with the abilities to run, jump, and slide. It requires nimble maneuvers on your part to avoid collisions with obstacles such as zombies or dinosaurs.

* Your score is constantly updated as you successfully navigate through and surpass the oncoming waves of zombies or dinosaurs. In the top-left corner of the game window, you'll find a display showing both your current score and the high score achieved.
When your character collides with a zombie or dinosaur, the game screen will freeze, indicating that you have been defeated. To restart and play again, simply press the Enter key.

* As you progress in the game, the difficulty level will intensify. Zombies or dinosaurs will accelerate rapidly towards you, requiring you to employ a combination of effective jumping and sliding maneuvers to navigate through the challenges.

* The game features two backgrounds, with the second one designed to be simpler. This makes it easier for you to see obstacles, especially because the zombies or dinosaurs move really fast during this part of the game.
